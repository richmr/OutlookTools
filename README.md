# OutlookTools
 Windows CLI tool to automate some Outlook activities.

 Works via MAPI interface to the user's Outlook session.

 Only works on Windows systems

 Current functions:
 - List mailboxes
 - List folders
 - Save all attachments found in a given folder to a given location
 - Send a plain text email (as the current user) with an attachment as desired.

 When installed should put a "OutlookTools.exe" on your path so can run from the command line

 The MAPI interface can do A LOT.  Basically anything you can do with VBA as described [here:](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/api/overview/outlook)
 
 Have fun extending
